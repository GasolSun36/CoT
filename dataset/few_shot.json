        "weak": "Q: Sheila, Purity, and Rose want to rent a house. Sheila has offered to pay five times Purity\u2019s share of the rent. Rose can only afford thrice what Purity pays. If Rose\u2019s share is $1,800, what is the total house rent? \nA: Reasoning Process: We are given that Rose's share of the rent is $1800, and that Rose can only afford thrice what Purity pays. Therefore, Purity's share of the rent is 1800 / 3 = $600. We are also given that Sheila has offered to pay five times Purity's share of the rent. Therefore, Sheila's share is 5 * 600 = $3000. Finally, we have Rose's share of $1800, Purity's share of $600 and Sheila's share of $3000. Therefore, the total rent is 1800 + 600 + 3000 = $5400. \nFinal answer: {5400}. \n\nQ: Padma is trading cards with Robert. Padma started with 75 cards and traded 2 or her valuable ones for 10 of Robert's cards. Robert started with 88 of his own cards and traded another 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. How many cards were traded between both Padma and Robert? \nA: Reasoning Process: Padma started with 75 cards. She traded 2 cards for 10 cards, so she now has 75-2+10=83 cards. Robert started with 88 cards. He traded 8 cards for 15 cards, so he now has 88-8+15=95 cards. The total number of cards traded between both Padma and Robert is 2+8+10+15=35 cards. This includes the 2 cards that Padma traded for 10 cards, the 8 cards that Robert traded for 15 cards, and the 10 and 15 cards that were traded between them. \nFinal answer: {35}. \n\nQ: Juanita goes through 1 bottle of sunscreen a month.  She likes to stock up for the entire year when a certain website offers 30% off her entire purchase.  If each bottle is $30.00 how much will all of the sunscreen cost after the discount? \nA: Reasoning Process: Juanita needs 1 bottle of sunscreen a month, and there are 12 months in a year, so she needs 12 bottles for the year. The website is offering a 30% discount on her entire purchase. Each bottle of sunscreen costs $30.00. To find the total cost of the sunscreen after the discount, we first need to find the discount amount. This is done by multiplying the price per bottle by the discount rate and the number of bottles: $30.00 * 0.3 * 12 = $108.00. Next, we need to find the price before the discount. This is done by multiplying the price per bottle by the number of bottles: $30.00 * 12 = $360.00. Finally, we subtract the discount amount from the total price before the discount to find the final price after the discount: $360.00 - $108.00 = $252.00. \nFinal answer: {252}. \n\nQ: On a three-day trip, Wendy drove 125 miles on the first day, and 223 miles on the second day.

They decided to combine their candies together and share them equally. How many candies will each one of them have? \nA: Reasoning Process: 1. Mark has 30 candies, Peter has 25 candies, and John has 35 candies. 2. We need to add the number of candies that each person has to find the total number of candies they have. 3. So, 30 + 25 + 35 = 90 candies.  4. Then, we need to divide the total number of candies by the number of people, which is 3. 5. So, 90 / 3 = 30 candies. \nFinal answer: {30}.\n\nQ: Ben's potato gun can launch a potato 6 football fields. If a football field is 200 yards long and Ben's dog can run 400 feet/minute, how many minutes will it take his dog to fetch a potato he launches? \nA: Reasoning Process: To find the total distance that the potato can travel, we need to multiply the number of football fields by the number of feet per football field. Since there are 3 feet per yard, and there are 200 yards per football field, we have 200*3 = 600 feet per football field. Therefore, the total distance that the potato can travel is 6*600 = 3600 feet. Since Ben's dog can run at a rate of 400 feet per minute, it will take the dog 3600/400 = 9 minutes to fetch the potato. \nFinal answer: {9}. \n\nQ: Brittany has 3 gerbils: Puffy, Muffy, and Scruffy. Puffy weighs 5 ounces more than Muffy. Muffy weighs 3 ounces less than Scruffy.  If Scruffy weighs 12 ounces, how much would the scale indicate, in ounces, if Brittany put Puffy and Muffy on the scale? \nA: Reasoning Process: We are given that Scruffy weighs 12 ounces and that Muffy weighs 3 ounces less than Scruffy. We are also told that Puffy weighs 5 ounces more than Muffy.  Using this information, we can calculate the weight of Muffy by subtracting 3 ounces from Scruffy's weight of 12 ounces, giving us a weight of 12-3 = 9 ounces for Muffy.  We can then calculate the weight of Puffy by adding 5 ounces to Muffy's weight of 9 ounces, giving us a weight of 9+5 = 14 ounces for Puffy.  If Brittany puts Puffy and Muffy on the scale, the scale would indicate a weight of 14+9 = 23 ounces. \nFinal answer: {23}.",

How long, in hours, will it take to complete the entire set of laundry?\nA: Reasoning process: 1. We need to calculate the time it takes to wash the laundry.\n2. We know that there are 8 loads of laundry and that each load takes 45 minutes to wash.\n3. Thus, the total time it takes to wash the laundry is 8 loads * 45 minutes/load = 360 minutes.\n4. Next, we need to find the time it takes to dry the laundry.\n5. We know that it takes 1 hour to dry each load of laundry and that there are 8 loads.\n6. Thus, the total time it takes to dry the laundry is 8 loads * 1 hour/load = 8 hours.\n7. Finally, we need to add the time it takes to wash and dry the laundry to find the total time it takes to complete the entire set of laundry.\n8. To find the total time it takes to complete the laundry, we first need to convert the 360 minutes of washing time to hours.\n9. 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours.\n10.

This is way too much for him to eat, so he gave some of it away to his friends. His friend Terry took 8 bushels, while Jerry only took 3. He gave 12 bushels to his friend Linda, who runs a food pantry. His neighbor Stacy doesn't eat much corn, but she still accepted 21 ears of corn from him. If each bushel contained 14 ears of corn, how many ears of corn does Bob have left?\nA: Reasoning process: First, let's figure out how many bushels of corn Bob gave away to his friends: 8 bushels + 3 bushels + 12 bushels = <<8+3+12=23>>23 bushels of corn.\nNext, let's figure out how many ears of corn are in 23 bushels of corn: 23 bushels x 14 ears/bushel = <<23*14=322>>322 ears of corn.\nFinally, let's figure out how many ears of corn Bob has left: Bob has 50 bushels of corn, but he gave away 23 bushels and 21 ears, so he has 50 bushels - 23 bushels = 27 bushels of corn left.\nEach bushel has 14 ears of corn, so Bob has 27 bushels x 14 ears/bushel = 378 ears of corn left.\nThe final step is to subtract the 21 ears that Bob gave to Stacy: 378 ears - 21 ears = 357 ears of corn left.\nFinal answer: {357}."

        "weak": "Question: What number has a 5:1 ratio to the number 11? Options: A:22  B:50  C:55  D:52  E:12     \nAnswer: Reasoning process: In order to find the number that has a 5:1 ratio to 11, we first need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio is a comparison of two numbers, and it is usually written in the form of a:b. In this case, the ratio is 5:1, which means that for every 5 units of the first number, there is 1 unit of the second number. Therefore, if we want to find the number that has a 5:1 ratio to 11, we need to find a number that is 5 times larger than 11. Then, we can check each of the given options to see if any of them are 5 times larger than 11. The only option that fits this description is [C:55].

Options: A:220 metre  B:230 metre  C:250 metre  D:260 metre  E:270 metre     \nAnswer: Reasoning process: We know that the train crosses a 250 metre long platform in 26 seconds at the speed of 72 kmph. To find the length of the train, we need to first convert the speed from kmph to m/s, so we use the formula: $V=V_{kmph}\times\frac{1}{3.6}$. Plugging in the values, we get: $V=72\times\frac{1}{3.6}=20$m/s. Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can use the formula: $D=Vt$ to find the distance the train covers in 26 seconds. Plugging in the values, we get: $D=20\times26=520$m. Since the length of the platform is 250 metre, and the train covers 520 metre in 26 seconds, the length of the train must be: $520-250=270$m. \nFinal answer: [E:270] metre.",
        "strong": "Q: A train 360 m long is running at a speed of 45 km/hr. In what time will it pass a bridge 140 m long?\nOptions: A:40 sec  B:42 sec  C:45 sec  D:48 sec  E:58 sec  \nA: Reasoning process: First, we need to calculate the speed of the train in meters per second. We know that 1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds, so the speed of the train in m/s is 45 km/hr * 1000 m/km / 3600 s/hr = 12.5 m/s\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes the train to pass the bridge. We know that the length of the train is 360 m, and the length of the bridge is 140 m.

E:15!\nA: Reasoning process: First, the first city must be connected to the remaining 14 cities.\nThis will take 14 road segments.\nNext, the second city must be connected to the remaining 13 cities.\nThis will take 13 road segments.\nFinally, the third city must be connected to the remaining 12 cities.\nThis will take 12 road segments.\nThis pattern continues until the last city is connected to the remaining 1 city.\nThis will take 1 road segment.\nTherefore, there are a total of 14 + 13 + 12 + ... + 1 = 14 * 15 / 2 = 105 road segments.\nThe correct option is: [B] 105.\n\nQ: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then find the speed of the boat in still water?\nOptions: A:6  B:7  C:8  D:5  E:3  \nA: Reasoning process: First, let's assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr.\nSince the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours.\nSimilarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours.\nAdding these two times, we find that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours.\nSolving for x, we find that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr.\nTherefore, the correct option is: [C] 8.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec?\nOptions: A:378m  B:350m  C:380m  D:200m  E:250m\nA: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour.\n2. We want to find the distance it will cover in 14 seconds.\n3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them.\n4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds.\n5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters.\n6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to find the distance in meters per second.\n7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters.\nFinal answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.\nTherefore, the correct option is: [A]."

Choices: A.backery   B.ham sandwich   C.fridge   D.butcher shop   E.freezer\nA: Reasoning process: Meat is something that can spoil quickly, so we need to find a place that can keep it fresh and prevent it from going bad.\nA backery is not a good place for keeping meat because it is usually warm and not refrigerated, which is not good for keeping meat fresh.\nA ham sandwich is not a good place for keeping meat because it is already made and ready to eat, so the meat is already exposed to the air and will go bad quickly.\nA fridge is a good place for keeping meat because it is cold and refrigerated, which is ideal for keeping meat fresh and preventing it from going bad.\nA butcher shop is not a good place for keeping meat because it is usually warm and not refrigerated, which is not good for keeping meat fresh.\nA freezer is also a good place for keeping meat because it is very cold and can keep the meat frozen, which prevents it from going bad and can last a long time.\nThe other choices are not good places for keeping meat because they are not cold enough or not designed for storing meat. As a freezer includes a fridge, it is the best option for keeping meat fresh and preventing it from going bad.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: [E. freezer].\n\nQ: What does someone living life fully feel? Choices: A.joy   B.valuable   C.happiness   D.early death   E.adventurous\nA: Reasoning process: 1. To understand what it means to live life fully, we need to consider that it could mean living life to the fullest or experiencing all aspects of life and making the most of every moment.\n2. Based on this understanding, we need to think about the emotions and feelings that someone who is living life fully might experience.\n3. Joy and happiness are positive emotions that align with the idea of living life fully.\n4. Other options like early death, valuable, and adventurous are not emotions or feelings and do not align with the idea of living life fully.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is either [A. joy] or [C. happiness]. Final Answer: [A. joy] is probably the better answer as it is more specific and relates more closely to the idea of living life fully.  So, the correct answer is: [A. joy] \n\nQ: Sky diving scared him, once they jumped out of the plane he began losing consciousness while what? Choices: A.injury   B.death   C.playing uno   D.coma   E.falling down\nA: Reasoning process: Sky diving scared him: This means he was afraid of sky diving.\nOnce they jumped out of the plane: This means they were in the plane, but then they jumped out.\nHe began losing consciousness: This means he was losing consciousness, or becoming unconscious.\nWhile what? This means we need to figure out what was happening while he was losing consciousness.\nFinal answer: From the given choices, the only one that makes sense in this context is option E, falling down. Falling down is the natural result of jumping out of a plane, and it could potentially cause someone to lose consciousness.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: [E] falling down.\n\nQ: The wood became fossilized, what did the paleontologists call it when they found ti? Choices: A.sanded   B.composted   C.warp   D.hardened   E.petrify\nA: Reasoning process: First, we need to understand what fossilization is. Fossilization is the process by which an organism is preserved in the fossil record. This can happen through a variety of processes, such as being buried in sediment, being exposed to high pressures and temperatures, or being replaced by minerals.\nNow let's look at the options given. We know that wood is a type of organism, so if it became fossilized, it would be preserved in the fossil record. We also know that the wood would have undergone some kind of process to become fossilized, such as being buried in sediment or being exposed to high temperatures and pressures.\nOption A, \"sanded,\" doesn't really make sense. Sanding is a process used to smooth wood or other materials, but it wouldn't have anything to do with fossilization.\nOption B, \"composted,\" also doesn't really make sense. Composting is the process of breaking down organic matter into a nutrient-rich soil amendment, but it wouldn't have anything to do with fossilization.\nOption C, \"warp,\" doesn't really make sense either. Warping is a term used to describe wood that has been bent or twisted out of shape, but it wouldn't have anything to do with fossilization.\nOption D, \"hardened,\" is a possibility. Hardening is a process that can happen to wood or other materials over time, as they become more dense and resistant to damage. This could be a possible outcome of the fossilization process, but it's not the only possibility.\nOption E, \"petrify,\" is the correct answer. Petrify means to turn into stone or a stony substance, which is exactly what happens to wood during the fossilization process. The wood becomes preserved in the fossil record, and is replaced by minerals over time. This process is called petrification, and the resulting fossil is called a petrified wood fossil.\nSo the correct answer is: [E. petrify]."
